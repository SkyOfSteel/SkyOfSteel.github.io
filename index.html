        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Ivan, and it's a pleasure to meet you! I am a postgrad student at George Brown College and a tech expert with sincere passion for cloud technologies.</p>
        <p>My original background is localization and technical writing in the fields of Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, and I also worked in customer-facing roles of Project Manager and Brand Ambassador, introduced quality control processes at my workplace and secured valuable contracts for my previous employers.</p>
        <p>I look to leverage my skills in the areas of Cloud Computing and System Administration. At this point of my career I am interested in building and maintaining cloud infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am working on improving my IT skillset. To this end, I have completed multiple training courses in AWS and Microsoft Azure, finished a sector-specific Cloud Computing Connections bridging program with ACCES Employment and Sheridan College in Canada. I have also obtained multiple AWS and Azure certificates.</p>
        <p>My approach to work combines experience, knowledge of best practices, and academic findings, and I put a strong emphasis on researching the subject matter before producing the expected results.</p>
