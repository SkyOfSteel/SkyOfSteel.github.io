        <h3>1. Custom VPN on an EC2 Server in AWS</h3>
        <p>
            To demonstrate my knowledge of AWS, I created a custom VPN hosted on an EC2 server and published the instructions to do so in my GitHub repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            The steps included spinning up a Ubuntu instance, allowing SSH connections over port 22 in the instance's Security Group, and creating a pair of security keys for the SSH login.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, I configured Security Groups to add an inbound rule to allow traffic from UDP port 1194.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the SSH terminal, I ran the following commands from the Readme in the openvpn-install repository:
        </p>
        <pre>
            sudo curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh
            sudo chmod +x openvpn-install.sh
            sudo ./openvpn-install.sh
        </pre>
        <p>
            After the installation was complete, an .OVPN file was created in the current EC2 directory. To use the VPN, I imported the .OVPN file into OpenVPN and connected to the server.
        </p>
